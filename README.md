Poll Me Baby!
=============

I am working with my friend Jimmy Dempsey on a semester project for ISAT 480: Mobile App Development.

We are working towards building a simple iOS clicker application. Through doing so we hope to experiment and explore the unique features that are available on the mobile platform which include: getting data from an API, hashing data/security, UI/UX development, and gesture implementation.
