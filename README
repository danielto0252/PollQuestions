I'm working with my friend Jimmy Dempsey, and this is our semester project for ISAT 480: Mobile Application Development. 

We are creating a basic clicker app in iOS and using that to experiment with various different smartphone features like: using/creating an API, hashing data/security, gesture implementation, and ui development.
